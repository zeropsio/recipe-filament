## Production vs. development

Base of the recipe is for development purpose. For production environment setup check [Filament production setup](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-filament/tree/main)

[//]: # (- Use highly available version of the PostgreSQL database &#40;change `mode` from `NON_HA` to `HA` in recipe YAML, `db`)

[//]: # (  service section&#41;)

[//]: # (- Use at least two containers for Jetstream service to achieve high reliability and resilience &#40;add `minContainers: 2`)

[//]: # (  in recipe YAML, `app` service section&#41;)

[//]: # (- Use production-ready third-party SMTP server instead of Mailpit &#40;change `MAIL_` secret variables in recipe YAML `app`)

[//]: # (  service&#41;)

[//]: # (- Disable public access to Adminer or remove it altogether &#40;remove service `adminer` from recipe YAML&#41;)

## Changes made over the default installation

If you want to modify your existing Filament app to efficiently run on Zerops, these are the general steps we
took:

- Add [zerops.yml](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-filament/blob/main/zerops.yml) to your repository, our
  example includes idempotent migrations, caching, and optimized build process
- Add [league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-filament/blob/main/composer.json#L23) to
  your composer.json to support Object Storage file system
- Setup health check if needed. Health checks are enabled out of the box in Laravel 11.
- Utilize
  Zerops [environment variables](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-filament/blob/main/zerops.yml#L22-L73)
  and [secrets](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-filament/blob/main/zerops-project-import.yml#L13-L14) to
  setup S3 for file system, Redis for cache and sessions, and trusted proxies to work with reverse proxy load balancer
